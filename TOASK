To make it easy:
A buy page with those filters :
    - What cryptocurrently would you like to buy. Propose a few but all are disabled except Monero
    - Amount
    - What you pay (Euro, roubles etc...)...
    - how you pay (bank transfer, revolut, bitcoin, etherium paysafecard etc etc...)
    and under, more filters :
    - confirmed ID not required
    - online only

    then under list of all the buy offers :)

 A sell page:
     - What cryptocurrently would you like to sell. Propose a few but all are disabled except Monero
    - Amount
    - What you pay (Euro, roubles etc...)...
    - how you pay (bank transfer, revolut, bitcoin, etherium paysafecard etc etc...)
    and under, more filters :
    - confirmed ID not required
    - online only

    then under list of all the sell offers :)
